# mmwave_model_integrator
python libraries for integrating deep learning models

## Installation
In order for the code to work properly, the following steps are required
1. Install correct version of python
2. Install mmWaveRadarProcessing using Poetry

### 1. Setup Python environment

#### Deadsnakes PPA (requires sudo access)
1. On ubuntu systems, start by adding the deadsnakes PPA to add the required version of python.
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

2. Update the package list
```
sudo apt update
```

3. Install python 3.10 along with the required development dependencies
```
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-dev
```

The following resources may be helpful [Deadsnakes PPA description](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa), [Tutorial on Deadsnakes on Ubuntu](https://preocts.github.io/python/20221230-deadsnakes/)

#### Conda (Backup)
1. If conda isn't already installed, follow the [Conda Install Instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) to install conda
2. Use the following command to download the conda installation (for linux)
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
3. Run the conda installation script (-b for auto accepting the license)
```
bash Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
```
3. Once conda is installed, create a new conda environment with the correct version of python
```
conda create -n mmWaveModelIntegrator python=3.10
```

### 2. Clone mmwave_model_integrator

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/davidmhunt/mmwave_model_integrator.git
```

Initialize the submodules
```
cd mmwave_model_integrator
git submodule update --init
```
### 3. Install mmwave_model_integrator using Poetry

### Installing Poetry:
 
1. Check to see if Python Poetry is installed. If the below command is successful, poetry is installed move on to setting up the conda environment

```
    poetry --version
```
2. If Python Poetry is not installed, follow the [Poetry Install Instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer). On linux, Poetry can be installed using the following command:
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Installing mmwave_model_integrator (with torch)
If your machine supports it Navigate to the mmwave_model_integrator foler (this folder) and execute the following command

```
poetry install --with submodules,torch
```

If you get an an error saying: "Failed to unlock the collection!", execute the following command in the terminal:
```
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
```

### Installing mmwave_model_integrator (with torch separately)
If your machine supports it Navigate to the mmwave_model_integrator foler (this folder) and execute the following command

```
poetry install --with submodules
```

If you get an an error saying: "Failed to unlock the collection!", execute the following command in the terminal:
```
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
```

Follow the following instructions to install the correct version of pytorch for your system.

1. Navigate to the [pytorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Select the requirements for your system. However, under the "package" select the "Pip" option. Once you have specified the options for your system, you'll get a command similar to this
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
2. Navigate to the mmwave_model_integrator folder
```
cd mmwave_model_integrator
```
3. Start a poetry shell
```
poetry shell
```
4. run the command given by the pytorch website
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
5. If this runs normally, you should now be good to exit the poetry shell
```
exit
```

#### Updating mmwave_model_integrator
If the pyproject.toml file is updated, the poetry installation must also be updated. Use the following commands to update the version of poetry
```
poetry lock --no-update
poetry install
```

### Using .env for Project Directories

In order to use any datasets in your computer's directory, you must first create a .env file and mark where the dataset files can be found.

1. Create a .env file in your project's root directory. This will file will not be uploaded to GitHub when you commit your changes.
2. Inside the .env file, add these variables
```
DATASET_DIRECTORY=/example/your_directory
MAP_DIRECTORY=/example/your_directory
MOVIE_TEMP_DIRECTORY=/example/your_directory
MODEL_STATE_DICT_PATH=/example/state_dict.pth
```
3. Replace the example text with the path to your directory
